This is my blog site since everyone needs of them. Plan is to use Wordpress Headless CMS for blog posts rather than using Markdown or MDX. I will be updating this fairly regularly depending on how I like it. Or this will eventually be archived and the posts will be folded into
<a href="https://johannemcclenahan.com/" target="_blank">personal site</a>.

The goal is to help me understand what I enjoy about life, the place I live at, and also UI / UX best practices, SEO optimization, and Content Management Services.
